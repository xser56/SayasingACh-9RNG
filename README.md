Description: Made a page that randomly chooses from a list of .json data of students with their name and email with HTML/CSS/JS.
Peer Review: Charles Orr
i think your code looks very nice and organized, i especially like how clean your second half looks compared to the block that i made
the only thing i recommend is making the boxes a different color from the background and double checking to make sure you dont need to have both emails
great job!
